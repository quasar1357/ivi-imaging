Between cells within replicate: biological variation    background, cell-heterogeneity
Between replicates within donor: technical variation    NOISE --> remove with normalization (e.g. empty slide parts) ?
Between donors within treatment: biological variation   background (random effect), individual heterogeneity
Between conditions: biological variation                interested


--> Do ANOVA and/or PCA?
