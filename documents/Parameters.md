## Parameters/adjustments for workflow

- Pre-processing (maybe for cell masks instead)
- (Deconvolution ?)
- Normalization across samples -> use controls
- (Segmentation)
- Dilation/erotion for mean
- Alternatives to mean signal (median, functions, filters...)
- Threshold for binning -> use controls (avg_ctrl + 3 * sd_ctrl)
- (>2 bins; evtl. with +/- around threshold)
